cfPaymill
=========

I am a ColdFusion wrapper component for the [Paymill](http://www.paymill.com/ "Paymill") API service.

I expose a series of [Paymill API methods](https://www.paymill.com/en-gb/documentation-3/reference/api-reference/ "Paymill API") as ColdFusion functions from an instantiated component.

For a demo, documentation and more information, please visit [http://www.cfpaymill.com/](http://www.cfpaymill.com/ "cfPaymill").
